# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Description
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm. The game is built using Python and Pygame, offering both a graphical interface and an intelligent computer player.

## Features
- Player vs AI gameplay
- Player vs Player mode
- Graphical user interface using Pygame
- AI opponent using minimax algorithm
- Option to play as X or O

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame
- Minimax Algorithm

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tic-tac-toe-ai`
4. Create a virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame` or Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the game using Python:

```bash
python runner.py
```
## How to Play
1. Choose game mode (Player vs AI or Player vs Player)
2. If playing against AI, select to play as X or O
3. Click on the grid to make your move
4. Try to get three in a row to win!

## AI Implementation
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move. It explores all possible game states to make optimal decisions, making it a challenging opponent.

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels for the AI
- Create a web-based version of the game
